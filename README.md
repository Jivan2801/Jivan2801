## 🚀 About Me

I am a backend-focused full-stack engineer specializing in scalable APIs, AI-powered systems, and cloud-native infrastructure.

Over the past 2+ years, I have:
- Designed and optimized production REST APIs
- Built RAG-based LLM systems with vector search
- Engineered observability platforms using Prometheus & Grafana
- Deployed containerized services on AWS and GCP
- Improved backend performance by 25%+ through query and architecture optimization

I enjoy solving complex engineering problems around scalability, reliability, and system design.
